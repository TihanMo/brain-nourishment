# Brain Nourishment 🧠📱

Brain Nourishment is a mobile app built with **React Native** using **Expo**. It offers a collection of **offline-capable minigames** that stimulate cognitive skills and help users activate their brain after long periods of passive screen time (e.g., doomscrolling).

## 🧩 Concept

This app is the digital counterpart to “Brain Rot” — instead of numbing your brain with endless content, Brain Nourishment delivers **quick, engaging challenges**. Each game requires focus, reaction, or memory.

### Core Features

- 🎮 Launch and play multiple minigames
- 📈 View high scores for each game
- ⚙️ Customize settings (Sound, Dark Mode, Vibration)
- 🌙 Dark Mode support
- 📵 Fully offline — no internet required
- 💥 Crash-safe: All user actions are gracefully handled

## 🔧 Architecture

The app is organized using a **modular component system** and follows clean separation of concerns:

```

├── /components           # Reusable UI (buttons, modals)

├── /navigation           # Stack Navigator config
├── /screens              # Main screens per route
│   ├── HomeScreen.js
│   ├── ReactionGameScreen.js
│   ├── ColorMatchScreen.js
